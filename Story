In a poor village, there lived a small family of four, a father, mother, and their two children, Jack and Jill. One day, the mother asked Jack and Jill to fetch her a pail of water from the well on top of the hill near their village. So the two kids took the pail that their father then gave them, and started up the hill. The father was concerned that they might not be able to carry the pail of water back home, so he accompanied them.
